// String. Although these methods throw exceptions, these exceptions are unchecked exceptions and thus 
// the try and catch blocks are not mandatory. The nextInt, nextDouble, â€¦ methods will throw an 
// InputMismatchException if the token retrieved cannot be converted to the expected data type. They will 
// throw a NoSuchElementException if there are no more tokens to retrieve. Finally, they will throw an 
// IllegalStateException if the Scanner object has been closed. We catch all these exceptions, from the 
// most specific to the most general and in the order in which they are most likely to be thrown.

// If we want to process all the tokens as Strings with a loop construct, we can call the hasNext method 
// to check if there are more tokens to process as in the following:

//	while ( parse.hasNext( ) ){
 //  System.out.println( parse.next( ) );
		//  }
		
// Eventually, when all tokens have been retrieved, the hasNext method returns false, which causes us to 
// exit the while loop.
